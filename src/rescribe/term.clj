(ns rescribe.term
  "This namespace is for the representation of the
  rewriting **terms**. 

  Almost any *finite* Clojure data, with the notable exception of `nil` 
  can be  considered as a valid term.

  The term categories are as follows:

    - **term variables** are symbols whose name
  begins with a question mark, e.g. `?X`, `?myvar`, etc.

    - **vector terms** are of the form `[t1 t2 ... tn]` with subterms `t1`, `t2`, ... `tn`.

    - **sequential terms** are of the form `(t1 t2 ... tn)` with subterms `t1`, `t2`, ... `tn`
      (infinite sequences cannot be terms).

    - **associative terms** are of the form `{k1:t1 ... k2:tn}` with keys (constants) `ki`'s associated to subterms `ti`'s.
      This is for maps, etc.

    - **constants** are everything else.
